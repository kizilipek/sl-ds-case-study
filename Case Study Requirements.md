## Preface
Marketing and new customer accquistion is a huge cost for any e-commerce retailer, it is also one of the most overlooked investments for newer firms.

## Task
Complete the following tasks and produce an multi-touch attribution model

### Analytics Plan
Define success How will you measure the success of this model?
Describe the data set and your analysis plan
### Data Preprocessing
Candidate was able to feature engineer in SQL
Candidate used Python over R
### Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Discuss transition states
2. Discuss the Customer booking window
3. Anything else interesting?
### Model Building
1. Justify choice of Model and choose a baseline model to compare this against
1. Build out your Model in (Python is preferred)
1. Conclusions from model
1. How would you improve on this if you had more time and the ability to request for more data?

### Bonus Points for following best practices
1. Frequent Meaningful Commits
1. Tidy code thatâ€™s modular
1. Using database over raw python for feature engineering (Snowflake has a free trial)
